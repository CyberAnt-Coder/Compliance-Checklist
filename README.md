## Compliance Checklist
Write an X beside each standard/policy Botium Toys must adhere to, as well as an explanation why.

### The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)

The FERC-NERC regulation applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. Organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. Organizations are legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection Reliability Standards (CIP) defined by the FERC.

**Explanation:**  
Botium Toys is not directly affected by FERC-NERC as it does not operate within the electricity or power grid sector.

### X-General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. citizens’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. Additionally, if a breach occurs and a E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed within 72 hours of the incident.

**Explanation:**  
Botium Toys must adhere to GDPR as it conducts business globally, including with E.U. citizens.

### X-Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.

**Explanation:**  
Botium Toys must follow PCI DSS standards due to its involvement in storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information.

### The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

HIPAA is a federal law established in 1996 to protect U.S. patients’ health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. Organizations have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach.

**Explanation:**  
Since Botium Toys does not work with health information, HIPAA is not relevant.

### X-System and Organization Controls (SOC Type 1, SOC Type 2)

The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization’s user access policies at different organizational levels. They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.

**Explanation:**  
Botium Toys must establish proper user access controls to mitigate risks for all personnel.
